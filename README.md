# Patrick Daniel's Personal Blog

A clean, minimal blog built with [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build and Preview
```bash
# Build the site
npx quartz build

# Build and serve locally
npx quartz build --serve
```

### Sync Content from Obsidian Vault
```bash
# Run the sync script
./sync-content.sh
```

This script automatically:
- Copies markdown files from your Obsidian vault
- Syncs images to the `content/images/` directory
- Updates image paths in markdown files

## ✏️ Writing New Posts

### Option 1: Write in Obsidian, then sync
1. Write your post in `/Users/patrick/Documents/Paper Notes/Personal Blog/`
2. Run `./sync-content.sh` to copy to Quartz
3. Build and preview

### Option 2: Write directly in Quartz
1. Create a new `.md` file in `content/posts/`
2. Add images to `content/images/`
3. Reference images with `![[images/your-image.png]]`
