## About Me

Hi! I'm Patrick Daniel. I'm currently a PhD Candidate in [Ocean Sciences](https://ocean.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz in the [Kudela Lab](http://oceandatacenter.ucsc.edu/home/). My research interests are in Coastal Phytoplankton Ecology. I'm also interested in how technology can support ocean observing.

## Projects
