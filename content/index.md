## About Me

Hi! I'm currently a PhD Candidate in [Ocean Sciences](https://ocean.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz in the [Kudela Lab](http://oceandatacenter.ucsc.edu/home/). My research interests are in Coastal Phytoplankton Ecology. I'm also interested in how technology can support ocean observing.

Before starting at UCSC, I worked for the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Before that I worked at the Hopking Marine Station of Stanford Univeristy in my hometown of Pacific Grove, CA.
